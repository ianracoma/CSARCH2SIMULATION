1. Application Purpose and Features
====================================================================


The purpose of the application is to be able to illustrate the step-by-step process of performing nonrestoring division on two numbers (either binary or decimal). The user has the option to either show each step on the click of a button, or to immediately show all the steps of the calculation.

The user also has the option to save the output of the calculation after all steps have been shown. The output of the calculation will be stored in a .txt file called "nrDiv.txt"

Note that there is a maximum and minimum limit to the possible values that you can enter into the application.
> Binary numbers are restricted to 16-bit binary numbers
> Decimal numbers can only accomodate the numbers 0 to 65535

2. Application How-to-use
====================================================================
ã€€

The usage of the application is simple:

1) Decide on which type of number you wish to input (Binary or Decimal). Select this by choosing between "Binary" or "Decimal" in the "Select Input Type:" section.

2) Decide whether you wish to show all steps in one click or show one step per click. Select this by choosing between "Step-by-step" or "All" in the "Select Output Type:" section.

3) Input a value for the dividend that corresponds to your selection in Step 1. Remember that there is a range to the inputs as mentioned in "Section 1: Application Purpose and Features"

4) Input a value for the divisor that corresponds to your selection in Step 1. Remember that there is a range to the inputs as mentioned in "Section 1: Application Purpose and Features". Note that 0 is not allowed and will not be processed by the application.

5) Click on "SUBMIT".

6) A box showing the values of "M", "-M", "A", and "Q" will be displayed. Press "START" to start the computation.

7) If you have selected "All", all steps will be shown immediately, if you have selected "Step-by-step" however, press "NEXT STEP" to advance to the next iteration.

8) Once all iterations have been performed, you may either opt to input another set of values using the "Input Again" button, or download the results of the computation by clicking the "SAVE AS TEXT FILE BUTTON"
